\usage{
fixSelectionIrt(
  model,
  predJointSub = NULL,
  predJointSubCond = NULL,
  dataSub,
  thres,
  funOfItems = sum,
  givenVar = NULL,
  nSimTheta = 500,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{IRT model object fitted with \code{\link{fitIrt}}.}

\item{predJointSub}{Optional prediction of the joint distribution of item
responses for the current person as returned by
\code{\link{predJointDistRespIrt}} before conditioning on selected items.
If \code{NULL}, the joint distribution is computed inside the function.}

\item{predJointSubCond}{Optional prediction of the joint distribution of
item responses for the current person already conditional on
\code{givenVar}. If supplied, it overrides \code{predJointSub} and no
further conditioning is performed.}

\item{dataSub}{One-row data frame for the current person containing item
responses and, if applicable, predictor variables used in the latent
regression.}

\item{thres}{Numeric vector of thresholds applied to the scores computed by
\code{funOfItems} to define binary decisions (one threshold per score
function).}

\item{funOfItems}{List of functions used to compute score(s) from the item
responses (e.g. \code{list(sum)} for a sum score, or several functions for
multiple decisions). Its length must match the length of \code{thres}.}

\item{givenVar}{Optional character vector with the names of items that are
treated as "selected" (fixed) and whose observed values in \code{dataSub}
are conditioned on. If \code{NULL}, predictions are based solely on the
IRT model without conditioning on specific items.}

\item{nSimTheta}{Number of latent variable draws used internally in
\code{\link{predJointDistRespIrt}}.}

\item{nSimItem}{Number of response patterns simulated per latent draw in
\code{\link{predJointDistRespIrt}}.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed used to make the simulation reproducible.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{pred}}{One-row data frame with predicted means
    (\code{predMean_*}), probabilities \code{P(score >= thres)}
    (\code{prob_*}), true score values computed from all items
    (\code{trueMean_*}), true decisions (\code{diag_*}), number of selected
    items (\code{nItems}), selected item combination (\code{combItems}),
    total runtime in seconds (\code{runTime}) and runtime per selected item
    (\code{runTimePerItem}).}
  \item{\code{distFun}}{Distribution of score functions used for prediction,
    as returned by the internal helper \code{.predFromJoint}.}
  \item{\code{chosen}}{Character vector with the names of the fixed
    selected items (i.e. \code{givenVar}).}
}
}
\description{
\code{fixSelectionIrt()} performs probabilistic predictions for a fixed set
of selected items based on an IRT model fitted with \code{\link{fitIrt}} and
probabilistic predictions from \code{\link{predJointDistRespIrt}}. In
contrast to \code{\link{dedaptiveIrt}}, no adaptive selection is performed:
a pre-specified set of items (\code{givenVar}) is used.
}
\details{
The function computes the joint distribution of item responses conditional
on the selected items (if provided) and then applies score functions
(\code{funOfItems}) and thresholds (\code{thres}) to obtain predicted
distributions of scores and decisions. The arguments \code{funOfItems} and
\code{thres} must have the same length (one threshold per score function).
