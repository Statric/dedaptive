\title{Fit multidimensional graded IRT models for use with \code{dedaptive}}
\usage{
fitIrt(respName, formula = NULL, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{respName}{Character vector with the names of the item/response columns
in \code{data}. These columns are treated as ordered responses and used to
fit the graded IRT model.}

\item{formula}{Either \code{NULL} (no latent regression), a character string
containing only the right-hand side of a regression formula
(e.g., \code{"age + sex"}), or a one-sided formula (e.g., \code{~ age + sex})
specifying the predictors for the latent regression.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the item responses specified in
\code{respName} and, if \code{formula} is not \code{NULL}, all predictor
variables referenced in \code{formula}. Each row typically corresponds to
one person.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{mirt::mirt()}, such as \code{model},
\code{technical} options, starting values, or convergence settings. The
estimation algorithm is currently fixed to the EM algorithm within
\code{fitIrt()}; other methods supported by \code{mirt} may be made
available in future versions.}

\item{model}{Specification of the latent structure passed to \code{mirt::mirt()}.
This can be a single integer (number of dimensions), a character string with
\code{mirt} model syntax, or an object created by \code{mirt::mirt.model()}.
By default, a unidimensional model (\code{model = 1}) is fitted.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{respName}}{Meta-data (character vector with the item names used in the model).}
  \item{\code{formula}}{Meta-data (The original \code{formula} argument as supplied by the user=.}
  \item{\code{varLabels}}{MA list of length \code{length(respName)}, where each
    element contains the sorted unique response categories for the corresponding item.}
  \item{\code{fit}}{The fitted \code{mirt} model object returned by
    \code{mirt::mirt()}. This object is used by \code{dedaptive} for prediction
    and item selection.}
}
}
\description{
The function \code{fitIrt()} fits multidimensional graded IRT models and
returns a model object that can be used for predictions and item selection
within the \code{dedaptive} library.

Technically, \code{fitIrt()} is a thin wrapper around \code{mirt::mirt()}:
it prepares the data, sets up an optional latent regression, and stores some
additional information (e.g., item labels) needed later by \code{dedaptive}.
If you plan to use an IRT model with \code{dedaptive}, you must always fit
it via \code{fitIrt()} rather than calling \code{mirt::mirt()} directly.
}
\details{
The function expects a set of item responses and, optionally, predictors for a
latent regression (e.g., age, sex). The names of the item columns are given
in \code{respName}, and the predictors are specified via \code{formula}.

The argument \code{formula} can be supplied either as
\itemize{
  \item a **character string** containing only the right-hand side (RHS) of a
    regression formula (e.g., \code{"age + sex"}), or
  \item a **one-sided formula** (e.g., \code{~ age + sex}).
}
Internally, character input is converted to a one-sided formula (e.g.
\code{"age + sex"} becomes \code{~ age + sex}) and then passed to
\code{mirt} as a latent regression. All predictor variables referenced in
\code{formula} must be available as columns in \code{data}.

Via the argument \code{model}, we can specify the latent structure, e.g., the
number of latent variables, which items load on which latent variables, and
whether the latent variables are correlated. The \code{model} argument is
passed directly to \code{mirt::mirt()}, so any model specification supported
by \code{mirt} can be used. For a full description of possible model
specifications, see \code{\link[mirt]{mirt}}.

Currently, the IRT model is estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as implemented
in \code{mirt} (i.e., \code{method = "EM"} in the underlying call to
\code{mirt::mirt()}). In future versions, additional estimation methods
supported by \code{mirt} may be exposed via \code{fitIrt()}.
