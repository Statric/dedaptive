\arguments{
\item{result}{List returned by \code{\link{dedaptiveIrt}} or
\code{\link{fixSelectionIrt}}, containing at least \code{distFun} and
\code{thres}.}

\item{whichScores}{Integer vector of length 2 indicating which two scores
to plot. For example, \code{c(1, 3)} plots \code{fun_1} against \code{fun_3}.
Defaults to \code{c(1, 2)}.}

\item{scoreNames}{Optional character vector of length 2 with labels for
the two scores (x- and y-axes). If \code{NULL}, default labels of the form
\code{c("Score i", "Score j")} based on \code{whichScores} are used.}

\item{main}{Main title for the joint scatterplot.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{Axis labels for the joint scatterplot. If \code{NULL},
they default to the corresponding \code{scoreNames}.}

\item{pointCexBase}{Base point size in the joint plot (scaled further by
relative frequency).}

\item{paletteColors}{Character vector passed to \code{grDevices::colorRampPalette}
to generate the colour scale for point frequencies.}

\item{thresholdCol}{Colour of threshold lines in all panels.}

\item{thresholdLty}{Line type of threshold lines.}

\item{thresholdLwd}{Line width of threshold lines.}

\item{probTextCol}{Colour of the probability texts in the joint plot.}

\item{probTextCex}{Character expansion for the probability texts.}

\item{legendN}{Integer; number of color steps in the embedded legend bar.}

\item{legendXleftRel, legendXrightRel}{Relative horizontal position of the
colour bar inside the joint panel (0 = left edge, 1 = right edge).}

\item{legendYbottomRel, legendYtopRel}{Relative vertical position of the
colour bar inside the joint panel (0 = bottom, 1 = top).}

\item{legendLabelOffsetXRel}{Relative horizontal offset (in plot-width units)
for the min/max labels to the right of the colour bar.}
}
\value{
Called for its side effect of producing a plot. Invisibly returns a list
containing the marginals and probabilities for the selected scores.
}
\description{
Creates a color-coded scatterplot (joint distribution) of two scores
(functions of item responses) together with plots of the marginal distributions
above and to the right. Thresholds are indicated by reference lines and
the probabilities are shown as well.

The function assumes that \code{result} comes from \code{\link{dedaptiveIrt}}
or \code{\link{fixSelectionIrt}} and contains elements \code{distFun} and
\code{thres}. Via the argument \code{whichScores}, you can choose which two score
functions (and corresponding decisions/thresholds) to visualize; by default,
the first two scores are used.
