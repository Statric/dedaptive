\title{Simulate item responses from a fitted IRT model}
\usage{
simResponsesIrt(model, dataPred = NULL, nSim = NULL, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{IRT model fitted with fitIrt().}

\item{dataPred}{Optional data frame with predictors for latent regression.}

\item{nSim}{Number of persons simulated when dataPred is NULL and no regression is used.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A data frame with predictors and simulated responses.
}
\description{
\code{simResponsesirt} simulates item response patterns from an IRT model
fitted with \code{\link{fitIrt}}, using the probabilistic machinery of
\code{\link{predJointDistRespIrt}}.
}
\details{
If the IRT model includes a latent regression (model$formula not NULL),
dataPred must contain all predictor variables used in \code{\link{fitIrt}}.
For each row in dataPred, one response pattern is simulated.

If the model has no latent regression (model$formula NULL) and
dataPred is NULL, then nSim must be supplied and nSim
response patterns are simulated.
